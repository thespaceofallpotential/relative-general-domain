### *—if a solution is easy to check, is it easy to find?*

i think that it's important to remember that *nature* is pretty big: and that it includes every single problem, *(and respective solution)*, ever devised *(or contrived)* by humans...

nerds of all kinds have a tendency to get a bit carried away with the specialness of our special-interests; the sparkle of our special-details; and the artificial contrivances, isolation, and multual-inconsistencies, of our most-cherished specialisms...

we tend to forget that all human specailisms — *(including all respective special-domain details, being part of nature, as they all are)* — *also, do not exist alone*...

> specailisms do not exist alone; special-domains do not exist alone; no problem or respective solution exists alone!
